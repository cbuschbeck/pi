Let's tell a story about a raspberry pi 

Ok, I'm going to tell a story about two of them. After setting up a Lab at home, I had to made a decision to split private and lab. A while ago I started to get a raspberry pi and was pretty pissed because I did not know where to start. Be patience is not my strongest characteristics. My first project included to start building a traffic lights. Work pretty well and wanted to do more, so i connected a 60W Light and connected the board to 230V power. Surprise surprise, nothing happen. I mean, no explosion, no electric shock... it was just possible to turn up the "real" light with a button on my pi. I was so proud, you should see that smile and the face of my wife. 

Today I'm using this little pi for networking services like DNS, DHCP, NTP, FTP, Webserver for HTML/PHP including a Database (MySQL, MariaDB) or just an owncloud
